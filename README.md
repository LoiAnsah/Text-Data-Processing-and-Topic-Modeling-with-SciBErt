# Text-Data-Processing-and-Topic-Modeling-with-SciBErt
This project builds an end-to-end NLP workflow for scientific papers. Using SciBERT and BERT-base for comparison. We also address class imbalance by focusing on top categories and show that UMAP + K-Means significantly outperforms PCA + K-Means for this dataset.
